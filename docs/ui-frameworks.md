# Two ideas

- **utility classes**
- component based

# What are utility classes?

We call it utility classes when we have a bunch of **small css
classes** with one single purpose each that we can pick and choose
from in our HTML for styling our UI.

```css
.color-red { color: #F00; }
.font-size-big { font-size: 2em; }
.font-size-med { font-size: 1em; }
.font-size-small { font-size: 0.7em; }
```

. . .

Let's see an example in **`utility-classes.html`**

# Tailwind

Tailwind is a CSS framework that allows us to create good looking HTML
websites withouth writing CSS, by only using **utility classes**.

Let's learn about it in **`tailwind.html`**

# Bootstrap

Unlike `Tailwind`, `Bootstrap` is component based.  This means that we
won't have as many fine-grained classes to style our UI, but we'll
have the concept of **components**.
