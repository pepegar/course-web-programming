# The box model

All tags in HTML will behave as boxes.  These boxes have some common
properties that we need to be aware of.

# The box model

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column}

- **width** and **height** apply to the content of the box

:::: {.column}

- **width** and **height** apply to the content of the box
- The **padding** is the distance from the content to the border

``` {.css}
background: #000;
width: 100px;
padding: 20px;
margin: 20px;
border: 5px solid orange;
```

some CSS rules that we can apply to boxes:

# Display

the CSS display property describes how an element's box behaves

All HTML values have a default display property.

# display - **block**

Block elements are those that start on a new line and fill their whole
container, from left to right.

Some block elements are **`<div>`**, **`<li>`**

# display - **block**

`display.html`

# display - **inline**

Inline elements do not break the flow of text in a paragraph.  Some
examples of inline-by-default elements are **`<a>`**, and **`<span>`**

# display - **inline**

`display.html`

# display - **none**

**`display:none`** makes the element not to be displayed in the screen.

# display - **none**

# Horizontal centering

One of the first things we'll want to do when creating the layout of a
webpage is centering the content horizontally.

This can be done using **margin** and **width**:

``` {.css}
body {
  width: 800px;
  margin: auto;
}
```

# Horizontal centering

but, what happens when we resize the window?

# Horizontal centering

**max-width** allows us to express the maximum width we want for a box,
so it resizes in case of smaller screens.

``` {.css}
body {
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: auto;
}
```

# Position

we use the **position** css property to make more complex layouts.

There are a number of different values for it:

# Position - **relative**

**`position: relative;`** allows us to place the element related to where it
would be placed by default.

We can move them with: **top, bottom, right,** and **left.**

# Position - **fixed**

with the **`position: fixed;`** attribute we can make elements that stay
in the same position.  These are elements whose position doesn't
change even when scrolling.

# Position - **absolute**

with **`position: absolute;`** we can place elements like with **fixed** but
relative to their *nearest positioned parent*

Investigate `position.html`
